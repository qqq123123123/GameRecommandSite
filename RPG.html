  <h1>World of Warcraft</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8">World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment.
    <br/>
    The game of World of Warcraft, or WoW, is set in a fictional world known as Azeroth and in the expansion The Burning Crusade extended the game to another world called Outland. The expansion Wrath of the Lich King added Northrend, the frigid northern continent of Azeroth. In the expansion Cataclysm, the classic continents of Azeroth were drastically changed as some zones were destroyed and new ones were unveiled. The expansion Mists of Pandaria added the southern continent, previously hidden behind a perennial mist cover, Pandaria. The latest released expansion, Warlords of Draenor adds Draenor, which is what Outland was before its partial destruction by Ner'zhul.

In the game, players design a character to play based on a number of starting options, such as the race of character and its type or class. Gameplay primarily consists of completing quests, dungeon runs and raids, and other in-game activities, in order to obtain rewards which will allow one to improve one's character and equipment in order to be able to complete the more difficult quests, dungeon runs and raids. Players can also participate in player versus player combat, either in large groups, small team matches, or individual skirmishes.

Over time, a number of additional features and improvements have been added to the game world, such as additional locations to explore, and seasonal and periodic events such as Halloween, Midsummer and weekly fishing competitions. Among the newer features added are a pet battle system akin to Pokémon, where players can collect pets all over the game world and battle with them and garrisons, which is an player-controlled area where players recruit non-player characters (NPC) to carry out quests to earn players or the NPCs items. Players can also modify their in-game experience through the use of third-party modifications such as macros and add-ons. Note that executable software that can edit the game mechanics (such as Glider) is against the terms of use.
