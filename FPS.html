  <h1>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is an online first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation. It is the fourth game in the main Counter-Strike franchise.
    <br/>Like the previous games in the series, Global Offensive is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. Each player joins either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team. The game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a team's objective is completed. For most game modes, once a player dies, they must wait until the round ends to respawn.

Players purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance. Completing objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions, like killing a teammate or hostage, takes money away from the player. In addition, when a round ends all players receive some amount of money, with players on the winning team receiving substantially more.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive added new weapons and equipment not seen in previous installments, most notably the firebomb for each side (referred to as a Molotov on the terrorist side and as an Incendiary Grenade on the Counter-Terrorist side). These temporarily cover a small area in fire, dealing damage to anyone passing through.
Cosmetic items, such as weapon finishes, were added post-release.

  <h1>OVERWATCH</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8">Overwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. 
    <br/>Overwatch features squad-based combat with two opposing teams of six players each. Players choose one of several hero characters, each with their own unique abilities and role classes. The four character roles include: offense characters with high speed and attack but low defense, defense characters meant to form choke points for enemies, support characters that provide buffs and debuffs for their allies and enemies respectively (such as healing or speed alterations), and tank characters that have a large amount of armor and hit points to withstand enemy attacks and draw fire away from teammates. During the pre-match setup, players on a team will be given advice from the game if their team is unbalanced, such as if they are lacking defensive heroes, encouraging players to switch to other heroes pre-match and balance the starting team. Within a match, players can switch between characters in-game following deaths or by returning to their home base, which is encouraged by the game's overall design.

Each hero has a primary attack or skill and at least two additional skills that can be evoked at any time, some requiring a brief cooldown period before they can be used again. Furthermore, each player slowly builds up a meter towards the one-time use of the character's "ultimate" skill; this meter builds up over time but can build up faster for defeating opponents or performing other beneficial tasks for their team. Once ready, the player can use this skill at any time, but then must wait for the meter to fill up again. A second meter tracks how many in-round points a player has scored, which are rewarded for killing or assisting in killing, providing team defense or healing, and scoring objective points. When a certain threshold is reached, the player character's icon will be "on fire", representing that that character is a threat, but otherwise does not directly affect gameplay.

  <h1>Tom Clancy's Rainbow SixÂ® Siege</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is the upcoming installment of the acclaimed first-person shooter franchise developed by the renowned Ubisoft Montreal studio. 
    <br/>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person tactical shooter, in which players take control of an operator from the Rainbow team, a counter-terrorist unit.
    In ranked, when a round begins, the attackers choose one of several spawn points from which to launch their attack. The attackers then are given control over wheeled drones to scout the map in search of enemy operators and targets, while the defenders can fortify and reinforce surfaces and pathways in order to restrict the enemy's team movement and vision, and use security cameras to spot the attackers. Maps in the game are designed to encourage close quarters combat, and players cannot respawn until the end of a round. This is aimed at encouraging players to utilize teamwork and tactics, and to maintain tension throughout a round. Matches are short and only last a few minutes.Teamwork and cooperation is encouraged in Siege, and players need to take advantage of their different abilities in order to defeat the enemy team Communications between players are also encouraged.

The game features heavy emphasis on environmental destruction.A procedural destruction system is featured in the game. Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make bullet holes. The environments of the game feature a layered material system, in which environmental objects of different materials show different reactions to player's attack. Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental destruction, and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy. In order to create a realistic gameplay, a bullet penetration system is featured, in which bullets deal less damage when they hit enemies through structures. In addition to destruction, players can also build fortified barriers and shields around them for protection, but can be destroyed through breaching and utilizing class specific melee-weapons like sledgehammers. In order to stop attackers' attacks, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire around the maps. Vertical space is a key gameplay element taken into account when designing the game's maps. Players can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades and breach charges are valuable, as only limited numbers can be used in a round.
