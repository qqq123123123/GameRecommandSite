    In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's "nexus", a structure which lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures. Each League of Legends match is discrete, with all champions starting off fairly weak but increasing in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game.

  <h1>DOTA2</h1>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-8">Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is the stand-alone sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), a mod for the 2002 video game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne.
    <br/>Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game set in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. Two five-player teams, referred to as the Radiant and Dire, compete in matches on an asymmetrical playing field. Each player commands one of 111 "Hero" characters, which each feature unique abilities and styles of play. At the start of a match, all Heroes have an experience level of one: they level up, and become more powerful, by accumulating experience points through combat. Whenever a Hero gains a level, the player may unlock a new ability for them, or enhance their statistics. Each Hero's method of combat is influenced by its primary "attribute": Strength, Agility or Intelligence.
The Radiant and Dire occupy strongholds in opposite corners of the playing field, divided by a river. Within each base is a critical structure called the "Ancient", along with a fountain that regenerates Heroes' health and magic points. A match ends when one side breaches the other's stronghold and destroys the Ancient therein. The two strongholds are connected by three paths, referred to as "lanes", which are guarded by defensive towers and computer-controlled creatures called "creeps". These creatures periodically spawn in groups and travel along the lanes to attack enemy Heroes, creeps and buildings. Also present are "neutral creeps" hostile to both Radiant and Dire, the most powerful of which is "Roshan", a respawning boss that may be killed by either side to obtain an item that allows a one-time resurrection by whoever that holds it.

During a match, the player receives a small, continuous stream of gold, which are spent on items that provide powers and stat enhancements to their Hero. Gold is also obtained by destroying enemy structures, killing creeps, and slaying Heroes. Only the Hero that lands the killing blow on a creep obtains gold from it, an act called "last hitting", but all nearby allies receive gold when an enemy Hero dies. Players may "deny" their opponents full gold and experience by destroying allied units and structures.
